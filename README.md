### Hi there 👋  I'm Shinri

I work as a mobile developer. 

Designing, developing and implementing all the mobile apps you use every day is hard.
Discuss client's proposed requirements and offer solutions to colleagues.
Develop application programming interfaces (APIs) to support mobile functionality to stay up-to-date with technology, concepts, and best practices for coding mobile applications.
Use, move, and adapt existing applications for more practical use in a mobile form.
Code, test, debug and monitor document changes for mobile apps.

hah..., I wish I could live like this normally.

### What am i doing now? 👨‍💻

Some manga and light novels are still unread, so I'll focus on that, and made my first game.

### If opportunity does not come to you, then create it!🌱
