### Hi there üëã  I'm Shinri

I work as a mobile developer. 

Designing, developing and implementing all the mobile apps you use every day is hard.
Discuss client's proposed requirements and offer solutions to colleagues.
Develop application programming interfaces (APIs) to support mobile functionality to stay up-to-date with technology, concepts, and best practices for coding mobile applications.
Use, move, and adapt existing applications for more practical use in a mobile form.
Code, test, debug and monitor document changes for mobile apps.

hah..., I wish I could live like this normally.

### What am i doing now? üë®‚Äçüíª

Some manga and light novels are still unread, so I'll focus on that, and made my first game.

### If opportunity does not come to you, then create it!üå±

Dogs are entered to compete with cheetahs, the goal is to find out who is faster.
Everyone was shocked that the cheetah didn't move from its place, they asked the race coordinator what happened!?
Sometimes trying to prove that you are the best is an insult.
We don't need to go down to someone else's level, to make him understand that we are the strongest.
"Think hard" and "save your energy" for what you deserve.
Cheetahs use their speed to hunt. Only for "Hunting"
not to prove to the dog who is faster and stronger.
